Bolt Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System-

This module  sends alerts over sms when the value crosses the threshold. In India over 6 Lakh litres of blood is discarded every year due to poor handling and unattended storage 
facilities in blood banks. Pharmaceutical companies face huge losses due to poor monitoring of the products.  Poor environmental monitoring not only effects pharma and medical 
industry but also leads to variable data loss and machine damage in data centers and server rooms across the country. The problem- traditional data loggers and chart recorders 
present in such facilities do not provide real time visibility and alerts.

In order to get real time visibility we replace these outdated systems  and introduce BTHM that is in all ways  cost effective and scalable.

BTHM also comes with a dedicated online dashboard where you can download, visualize your data remotely without having to collect and report it manually. You can set the threshold,
download custom reports and even decide whether to get alerts on messages or email. It does not require any manual  intervention on day to day basis. With bolt you have unlimited 
storage capacity and  life time warranty which means you can save your data safely and securely for as long as you wish. BTHM combines the cutting edge technology and industrial 
grid sensors to deliver critical data you need, no matter where you are.
